PLL for a micro
    TSMC 180nm
        Lmin = 0.18um
        Wmin = 0.42um
        LDmin = 0.48um
        Vdd = 1.8V??
        WPFACT = 1.5
        t_ox = 4.1 nm
        C'ox = 8418 aF/um^2
    Digital PLL (DPLL)
    clock multiplier
    input is reference clock
        what range?
    components
        prescaler ???
            divider on input clock
        PLL
            phase comparator
                add a lock signal?
            loop filter
                charge pump - why?
                low pass filter
            VCO
            divider N
                means VCO output is N times the input to the phase comparator
        postscalar M
            VCO can only output a certain range
            We can use this to get less than that
            Fout = N Fin / MP
    Dividers
        prescaler, postscalar, PLL divider
        basic divide by 2^x? Or more complex divide by n
            X bit incrementer
            comparator

    Design spec
        output skew
        output frequency range
            100MHz - 2GHz?
    Measurements
        variables:
            jitter on input
            different input frequencies
            different Vdds
            nois on the DC supply
            different voltage on the reference
            noise on the reference
            temperature
        metrics:
            output jitter
            output frequency
            lock time
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop_ranges
            Mariano dice incluir:
                La simulación de cada bloque del PLL por separado mostrando la máxima frecuencia de operación en cada caso.
                Estimar el K_VCO por simulación graficando frecuencia vs tensión de entrada
                Estimar el pull-in range y lock-in range.
    To further improve the phase noise of the output, an injection locked oscillator can be employed following the VCO in the PLL.

VCO current source:
    1) 10uA center:
        L = 3u
        WN_CS = 30u
        WPFACT_CS = 1.5
        R1_CS = 11.7k
        R2_CS = 100G
        WIDE_FACT = 3
    2) 10uA center, 5uA min:
        L = 0.9u
        WN_CS = 4u
        WPFACT_CS = 1.5
        R1_CS = 20k
        R2_CS = 86k
        WIDE_FACT = 3

VCO:
    Ctot = 5/2 C'ox (WpLp + WnLn)
    f = Id / N Ctot Vdd

    For current source 1)
        L = 0.18u
        W = 1.95u
        gives f centre = 400MHz range of 0MHz to ~1GHz
        K_VCO ~= 660e6 * 2pi rads / Vs = 4.1e9 rads / Vs

    For current source 2)
        L = 0.18u
        W = 0.57u
        gives f centre = 140MHz range of 62MHz to 330MHz

    Size the current source transistors correctly
        how to do this?
        We want 10uA for now, where's that.
    http://emlab.uiuc.edu/jose/Theses/mehta_ms.pdf
        read up on deadzone. Make sure we are good
    Measure current in right hand branch of current mirror for Vin DC spread
    Increase W/L of inverters in VCO, because maybe for min values they can't
        handle the current from the current mirror. Also try increasing W.
        So that W/L != Wmin/Lmin.
    Try calculating Fcent = Id / N Ctot Vdd, for N=7 Id=10uA. Is f accurate?
        increase L and W and .. of VCO, now is it accurate
        maybe simulate .step of W/L? or W?
        If it's still massively unaccurate, then try to measure Ctot in some way
            How to measure Ctot of an invertor in spice?
